## 🚀 Deploying the MCP Server

### Option 1: Local Installation (Recommended)

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd G:\mcp\React_cve_MCP
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Test the scanner module:**
   ```bash
   python scanner.py
   ```

3. **Add to Claude Desktop config:**

   Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (or equivalent):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "react-cve-scanner": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["G:\\mcp\\React_cve_MCP\\server.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**

5. **Test the MCP:**
   In Claude, ask: "Scan G:\projects for CVE-2025-55182 vulnerabilities"

### Option 2: Publish to NPM/PyPI (For Community)

1. **Create GitHub repository:**
   ```bash
   cd G:\mcp\React_cve_MCP
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial release: CVE-2025-55182 MCP Scanner"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-cve-mcp.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Publish to PyPI:**
   - Create `setup.py`
   - Register on PyPI
   - `python setup.py sdist upload`

3. **Share with community:**
   - Post on Twitter/X
   - Share on Reddit (r/reactjs, r/webdev)
   - Post on Dev.to
   - Share in Discord communities
