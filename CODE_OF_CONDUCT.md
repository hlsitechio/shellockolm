We're all here to make software more secure. Let's keep it simple:

---

## ✅ Do This

- **Be helpful** - We're all learning
- **Be respectful** - Different opinions are good
- **Give constructive feedback** - "Try this" beats "That's dumb"
- **Own your mistakes** - We all make them
- **Focus on the code** - Not the person

## ❌ Don't Do This

- **Don't harass anyone** - Zero tolerance
- **Don't troll** - Keep it productive
- **Don't share private info** - Respect privacy
- **Don't be sexist/racist/bigoted** - Everyone's welcome here
